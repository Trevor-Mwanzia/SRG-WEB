Please place the attached background image file in the project root with the exact filename:

  hero-attachment.png

Path from CSS: `css/styles.css` -> url('../hero-attachment.png')

Notes:
- This repository tool cannot write binary image files for you. Save the actual image (from the attachments) using the name above.
- The CSS will display the image top-aligned and sized using `background-size: contain` so the image won't be zoomed in.
- If you prefer the image to fill and crop instead, change `background-size: contain` to `background-size: cover` in `css/styles.css`.

If you'd like, I can also convert the image into a web-optimized file *if* you paste a base64 data URL here or provide the SVG source.
